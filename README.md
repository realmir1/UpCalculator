# Advanced Tkinter Calculator

## Overview

This project is a **professional-grade, advanced calculator** built with **Python's Tkinter** GUI library. It supports multiple modes, including scientific, programmer, and unit conversion, making it far more capable than a basic calculator.

The application is designed with a modular architecture for scalability, ensuring that new features and functions can be added easily.

## Features

* **Basic Arithmetic:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
* **Scientific Functions:** Trigonometric, logarithmic, power, root, factorial.
* **Programmer Mode:** Binary, octal, hexadecimal conversions, bitwise operations.
* **Unit Conversions:** Length, weight, temperature, and more.
* **History Panel:** Keeps track of previous calculations.
* **Memory Functions:** M+, M-, MR, MC.
* **Theme Support:** Switch between light and dark modes.
* **Error Handling:** User-friendly error messages.

## Requirements

* **Python 3.8+**
* **Tkinter** (included in standard Python installations)
* **math** module (standard library)
* **datetime** module (standard library)

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure Python 3.8 or higher is installed.
3. Open a terminal in the project directory.
4. Run the application with:
